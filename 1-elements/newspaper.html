   <h1>For First Time, Tests With Gene Therapy Begin</h1>
   <h4>Jan. 30, 1991</h4>
   <p>Two cancer patients yesterday became the first people to receive gene therapy in an attempt to defeat otherwise incurable tumors.</p>
   <p>In a simple procedure that lasted barely 20 minutes, the patients, a 29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man, were each infused with about 100 million white blood cells. The cells enfolded a genetically engineered copy of a gene that makes a potent anti-cancer enzyme.</p>
   <p>The extremely experimental method is intended to deliver the enzyme, tumor necrosis factor, directly to colonies of tumors cells that have spread throughout the body. Once at the tumor site, the enzyme, in theory, will disintegrate the malignant tissue while leaving the rest of the body unscathed.</p>
