     <b>Cutting Down, Ramping Up:</b>
     We have a robust strategy for <s>low-hanging fruits</s> mission-critial objectives that move the needle at all costs. 
     Circling back on the Q3 forecast and looking holistically from a KPI standpoint… 
     <b>let's double down</b> on <u>revenue growth</u>. Employee #293 is spearheading this win-win initiative; a win for us and our amazing shareholders!

     P.S. After several strong sales months, we have decided to print <b>Employee Appreciation Tees</b>! These shirts will go on sale Monday.
